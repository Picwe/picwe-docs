#### Security Measures

- Smart Contract Audits: All PicWe contracts, including $WEUSD mint/redeem and cross-chain contracts, undergo professional security audits.
- Decentralized Architecture: Master-slave contracts distributed across multiple chains reduce single points of failure.
- Permissionless Operations: Users maintain full control of their assets; PicWe cannot access or move funds.
- Continuous Monitoring: Real-time monitoring ensures quick detection of anomalies or suspicious activity.

#### Bug Bounty Program

PicWe rewards security researchers and community members who identify bugs or vulnerabilities:

- Eligibility: Anyone can participate, including independent auditors and developers.
- Rewards: Monetary incentives or $PIC token rewards for valid findings.
- Goal: Strengthen protocol security and ensure safe cross-chain transactions.

#### Conclusion

By combining professional audits, decentralized design, and community-driven bug reporting, PicWe creates a secure, resilient, and trustworthy ecosystem for $WEUSD holders, RWA investors, and AI-powered agents.
