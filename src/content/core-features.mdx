#### **2. Standardized RWA Issuance**

- Issue tokenized assets in under 3 minutes using predefined smart contract structures.
- Ensures consistent, secure, and automated onboarding of new RWAs.

#### **3. Economic Mechanism for Value Investing**

- Each RWA token acts like a micro-economy, with its own treasury, tax policies, and floor prices.
- Aligns incentives between investors and project teams.

#### **4. Continuous Fundraising**

- Returns (APY) are delivered through linear token releases, linking project performance to investor rewards.

#### **5. Sustainable Growth**
