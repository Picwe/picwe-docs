PicWe’s growth is mapped out in stages, each inspired by the great explorers who opened up new trade routes. Just as their voyages connected distant continents, each phase of PicWe connects isolated blockchain networks to unlock a truly global flow of digital assets.

#### “Dias” Phase: The First Breakthrough

Like Dias’ discovery of a new sea passage, PicWe’s first step is enabling swaps between the Movement blockchain and EVM networks. This proves the potential of cross-chain liquidity, opening the first routes across the “oceans” of blockchain finance.

#### “Columbus” Phase: Expanding Horizons

PicWe expands from single-chain to multi-chain trading. EVM users gain direct access to the Movement blockchain’s new opportunities, just as Columbus opened access to new lands. This phase creates a bridge between established crypto ecosystems and emerging markets.

#### “Da Gama” Phase: Unlocking High-Value Markets

In this stage, liquidity flows back from multi-chain ecosystems into powerful single chains like Solana. Similar to Vasco da Gama’s trade routes to India, this phase connects users to high-value markets, unlocking broader participation and deeper liquidity.

#### “Magellan” Phase: True Multi-Chain Interoperability

Magellan circumnavigated the globe to show how everything is connected. Likewise, PicWe unites liquidity across EVM, Solana, MOVE and Bitcoin, creating real multi-chain interoperability. Liquidity moves freely to wherever innovation happens, without fragmentation.

#### “Drake” Phase: Full Omni-Chain Liquidity

In the final stage, PicWe delivers seamless omni-chain liquidity. Assets can move between any blockchain or token standard with ease. A unified liquidity consensus ensures that every swap, transfer, or investment strengthens the network, ushering in a new era of DeFi and RWA interoperability.

**The Big Picture**

PicWe’s journey mirrors the explorers who reshaped global trade. Step by step, PicWe is building an open, decentralized financial future where every blockchain is connected, liquidity flows without barriers, and both crypto and real-world assets (RWAs) can move as freely as goods once did across the oceans.
