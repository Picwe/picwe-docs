#### PicWe: A simple Explanation

PicWe connects isolated blockchain chains so money and assets can move easily and safely between them. It’s an omni-chain crypto infrastructure that brings together blockchain and real-world assets (RWAs) for faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions. PicWe’s role is not only to give RWAs DeFi attributes, but to link the real world and the blockchain world to achieve free asset flow and value realization.

**The problem: many blockchains don’t talk to each other**

Blockchains today are like islands: each has its own money and users, and that makes it hard to move value between them. Tools called “bridges” were created to connect chains, but they’re often slow, expensive, and have caused big security problems. At the same time, some security models (like Proof-of-Stake) depend on how much value is locked on a chain. When money is spread thin, smaller networks become easier to attack. The growing number of blockchains and digital assets means we need a better way to share liquidity and keep systems secure.

**PicWe’s solution: omni-chain liquidity without risky bridges**

PicWe removes the need for risky bridges by creating a bridgeless, omni-chain liquidity infrastructure. That means assets can be used across PicWe’s omni-chain infrastructure, while staying on their original chain. PicWe links these chains so liquidity flows smoothly, securely, and efficiently. Making it easier to trade, invest, and settle value across the crypto ecosystem.

**How it works (in plain terms)**

- **Proof of Liquidity (POL):**\
  People and institutions who provide liquidity help secure the network and earn rewards. Think of it as contributing funds that both enable trading and protect the system.
- **Omni-Liquidity Byzantine Consensus (OLBC):**\
  A technical method PicWe uses to spread liquidity and keep the network stable and fault-tolerant across multiple chains. (It’s the behind-the-scenes system that helps everything run smoothly.)
- **Bridgeless transactions:**\
  Instead of locking or wrapping tokens and moving them between chains, PicWe coordinates trades while assets remain on their home chains, lowering risk and complexity.
- **Simple cross-chain payments:**\
  Users can trade or pay across blockchains with fewer steps and fewer wallets, similar to using a single payment app for several currencies.

**Why it matters**

- **Better security:** \
  Reduces vulnerabilities linked to traditional cross-chain bridges.
- **Lower costs & faster transactions:** \
  Simpler flows mean fewer fees and faster settlement.
- **Unified liquidity:** \
  Keeps value accessible and useful across PicWe’s omni-chain infrastructure.
- **Practical for DeFi and RWAs:** \
  Makes it easier to invest in tokenized real-world assets (bonds, real estate, commodities) and use DeFi tools in a safer, more connected way.

**Progress & traction**

PicWe has already earned recognition in DeFi communities and shown strong early test activity. This demonstrates the idea works in practice and is attracting users and developers.

**DeFi 1st Prize Winner:**

Recognized at Movement’s Battle of Olympus Hackathon for its pioneering approach to liquidity and decentralization.

**Testnet Success:**

Within weeks of launch, PicWe achieved 838,000 wallet addresses, 112,000 interactions, and $14.6 million in transaction volume.

#### The vision

PicWe’s goal is to become the settlement and payments infrastructure for the third generation of finance in human society. Therefore, PicWe’s vision extends beyond blockchain to the broader human economic system
