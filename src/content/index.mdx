**🧩 Core Products**

**1. $WEUSD: The stablecoin behind stablecoins**

$WEUSD is not just another global stablecoin; it is a **settlement stablecoin** designed for omni-chain settlement. Since each blockchain functions as its own independent ledger, cross-chain transactions are difficult to reconcile. $WEUSD solves this by implementing an omni-chain ledger that enables settlement across different chains. For users, this means they can spend with any cryptocurrency on the front end, while in the background all settlements are finalized in $WEUSD. In this way, $WEUSD acts as the “stablecoin behind stablecoins,” serving as the backbone for seamless and consistent multi-chain transactions.

**2. RWA Launchpad – Initial RWA Offering (IRO)**

- A marketplace for bonds, real estate, commodities, and revenue-sharing products issued digitally.
- Decentralized. Achieves standardized issuance of RWAs through smart contracts
- &#x20;Downside Protection Mechanism, protecting investors
- Works with $WEUSD and will expand across PicWe’s omni-chain infrastructure.

**3. PicWe Swap**

PicWe Swap allows users to exchange digital assets instantly across PicWe’s omni-chain infrastructure, making trading fast and simple.

Omni-chain Swap (Coming Soon)\
