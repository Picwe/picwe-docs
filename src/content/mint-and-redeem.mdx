## Overview

WEUSD is the settlement currency for the entire RWA economy. Right now, every WEUSD is backed 1:1 by USDC—the most trusted digital dollar. But this is just Phase 1.

As the ecosystem grows, WEUSD collateral expands to include **tokenized treasuries, real estate yields, commodity reserves, and revenue-generating RWA**. Same stability. Deeper, more diversified backing. Real assets you can verify on-chain.

## Mint WEUSD

Turn your USDC into WEUSD. Simple as that.

### How It Works

1. **Connect** — MetaMask, OKX Wallet, any Web3 wallet
2. **Pick Network** — BSC, Base, Arbitrum, wherever you are
3. **Approve** — One-time USDC approval
4. **Mint** — Enter amount, confirm, done
5. **Receive** — WEUSD lands in your wallet

### On-Chain Flow

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | You send USDC to Mint Contract |
| 2 | Contract locks USDC in reserve |
| 3 | Contract mints equal WEUSD to you |

**Result:** 100 USDC in → 100 WEUSD out. Always.

### Requirements

- USDC on your chosen network
- Gas for the transaction
- That's it

## Redeem WEUSD

Need your USDC back? Burn WEUSD, get USDC. No questions asked.

### How It Works

1. **Connect** — Same wallet
2. **Pick Network** — Where your WEUSD lives
3. **Approve** — One-time WEUSD approval
4. **Redeem** — Enter amount, confirm
5. **Receive** — USDC back in your wallet

### On-Chain Flow

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | You send WEUSD to Mint Contract |
| 2 | Contract burns WEUSD permanently |
| 3 | Contract releases USDC to you |

**Result:** 100 WEUSD in → 99 USDC out (after 1% redemption fee).

## Fee Structure

| Operation | Fee | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Mint** | 0% | We want you in the ecosystem |
| **Redeem** | 1% | Supports protocol operations & Keeper rewards |

Gas fees are separate—that's between you and the network.

---

## Why This Matters

| Feature | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **1:1 Backing** | Every WEUSD backed by real value—USDC now, diversified RWA later |
| **No Slippage** | Fixed rate. Mint 1M, still 1:1 |
| **Instant** | Seconds, not minutes |
| **No Lock-up** | Redeem whenever you want |
| **Multi-Chain** | Mint on any supported network |

## The Roadmap

### Phase 1: USDC Foundation (Now)

Simple, secure, battle-tested:
- 100% USDC backing
- Instant mint/redeem
- Trust the most liquid stablecoin

### Phase 2: RWA Collateral Expansion (Coming)

WEUSD becomes backed by a diversified basket:

| Collateral Type | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Tokenized Treasuries** | US government backing—doesn't get safer |
| **Real Estate Yields** | Stable cash flows from property |
| **Commodity Reserves** | Gold, silver—hard asset foundation |
| **Revenue RWA** | Tickets, royalties, carbon credits—yield potential |

**The upgrade:** When WEUSD is backed by yield-bearing RWA, holders can earn passive returns. Same stability. More upside.

---

## The Bigger Picture

WEUSD isn't a stablecoin. It's the reserve currency of tokenized finance.

- **Cross-Chain** — Move WEUSD anywhere in seconds
- **RWA Gateway** — Buy real-world assets on any chain  
- **Yield Layer** — Earn from RWA collateral (coming)
- **Settlement Standard** — The dollar of the RWA economy

The 1% redemption fee funds the Keeper network that keeps liquidity balanced across all chains. You're not paying a fee—you're powering the infrastructure that makes omni-chain RWA possible.
