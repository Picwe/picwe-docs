# Bidding Agency

<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', clear: 'both', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '1.25rem' }}>Dynamic Liquidity for Omni-Chain Trading</div>

The Bidding Agency is PicWe’s innovative model for on-demand liquidity, enabling users to trade assets across blockchains efficiently and securely. Unlike traditional liquidity pools, liquidity is only provided when a trade order is placed, making capital usage far more flexible and efficient.

### **How the Bidding Agency Works**

1. **Order Placement and Visibility**

- Users place a trade order on their original chain.
- The order is broadcast to the target chain, visible to all participants.

2. **Dutch Auction Pricing**

- Orders are priced through an open Dutch auction.
- Users set slippage, which influences how the price adjusts during the auction.

3. **Arbitrage Execution**

- When an opportunity arises, the Bidding Agency provides the required tokens.
- In return, it receives the user’s locked collateral.

### **Benefits**

- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency:** Liquidity is used where it’s needed most.

#### Analogy: CATM as a Global Port Container System

- Purchase a container at any port → Receive certificate of ownership.
- Sell the certificate later for profit or retrieve the goods.
- CATM and the Bidding Agency operate similarly, letting assets move seamlessly without bridges, while remaining securely locked in smart contracts.

#### Conclusion

The Bidding Agency model maximizes liquidity efficiency, benefits both users and providers, and supports PicWe’s vision of DeFi 2.0: a fully decentralized, dynamic, and interconnected omni-chain ecosystem.
