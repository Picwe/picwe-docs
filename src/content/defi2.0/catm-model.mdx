The **Chain Abstraction Transaction Model (CATM)** is the backbone of PicWe’s omni-chain asset liquidity, enabling secure, seamless cross-chain trading without relying on traditional bridges. Think of it as a global port container system for digital assets: you can trade, hold, or transfer ownership without physically moving the assets across chains.

#### How CATM Works

1. **Order Initiation on the Original Chain**

- Users place a trade order on their current blockchain.
- The order details are sent to the target chain via a Relayer.
- An agent on the target chain provides the tokens for the order and receives the staked funds.

2. **Direct Asset Purchase Without Bridges**

- Trade any asset on another chain directly, without transferring tokens through bridges.
- Assets remain locked in smart contracts until the transaction completes.
- Eliminates risks associated with traditional cross-chain bridges.

3. **Cost and Efficiency Savings**

- Removes the need for two-step transfers, lowering transaction and gas fees.
- Simplifies the process for faster and more economical trading.

4. **Direct Asset Purchase Without Bridges**

- All actions, order placement, settlement, and purchase, are handled by smart contracts.
- Users maintain complete control over their assets.
- Anyone can participate using their own or third-party Relayers.

#### CATM in Everyday Terms

Imagine a global container port network:

- You can buy goods in a container at any port and receive a certificate of ownership.
- Sell the certificate if the value rises, or pay shipping to retrieve the goods.
- CATM works similarly for digital assets, letting you trade and manage ownership without moving the assets across chains.

**Why CATM Matters**

CATM revolutionizes omni-chain liquidity by:

- Reducing costs and increasing speed for cross-chain transactions.
- Keeping assets securely locked in smart contracts.
- Providing a fully decentralized, permissionless framework for trading across blockchains.

With CATM, PicWe enables true Web3 interoperability, allowing assets to flow freely across chains while keeping users in full control.
