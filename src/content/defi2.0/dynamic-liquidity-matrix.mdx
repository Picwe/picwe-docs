The Dynamic Liquidity Matrix (DLM) is PicWe’s solution to fragmented blockchain liquidity. It consolidates assets from multiple chains into a single, unified pool, enabling faster, safer, and more efficient trading without relying on private keys or complex bridges.

#### Challenges with Traditional Liquidity

- Fragmentation: Liquidity is scattered across chains and bridges, limiting capital efficiency.
- Complexity: Users must navigate multiple bridges or wallets to trade.
- High Slippage: Large trades can face significant price differences due to low liquidity on individual chains.
- Isolated Assets: Tokens remain siloed, making trading and leverage difficult.

#### How DLM Works

**1. Direct Liquidity Contribution**

- Users deposit **USDT** into PicWe’s on-chain liquidity pool.

**2. Unified Liquidity Pool**

- Smart contracts aggregate all contributions into **one cross-chain pool** accessible from any supported chain.

**3. Proportional Rewards**

- Users earn rewards **based on their share** of the total liquidity, **continuously**.

#### Advantages of DLM

- **Easy to Use:** Deposit USDT once and start earning rewards immediately.
- **Maximized Returns:** Pooling liquidity across chains optimizes capital allocation, increasing potential yields.
- **Secure and Decentralized:** Smart contracts manage all funds; PicWe cannot access user assets.
- **Permissionless Participation:** Anyone can contribute to the liquidity pool.
- **Efficient Capital Use:** Liquidity flows where it’s most needed, reducing slippage and lowering transaction costs.

| **Total Liquidity**        | $18B fragmented            | $18B unified across all chains         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Distribution** | Each chain/bridge separate | Unified pool accessible by all chains  |
| **Asset Integration**      | Siloed per chain           | Seamless cross-chain sharing           |
| **Capital Efficiency**     | Low                        | High, dynamic allocation               |
| **Price Slippage**         | High in large trades       | Significantly reduced                  |
| **Liquidity Provision**    | Locked to pairs            | On-demand, non-directional             |
| **User Experience**        | Complex, multiple bridges  | Simplified, single access              |
| **DeFi Evolution**         | Single-pair LPs            | DeFi 2.0, dynamic omni-chain liquidity |
