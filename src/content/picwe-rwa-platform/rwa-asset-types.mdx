# RWA Asset Types

<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', clear: 'both', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '1.25rem' }}>Explore the Classification of Tokenized Real-World Assets.</div>

PicWe makes it possible to invest in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) across multiple categories. These assets are brought on-chain, giving investors more ways to diversify and earn from the real economy.

      <Table.Td>Debt-type assets (e.g., notes, bonds, accounts receivable)</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>
        Financial assets with guaranteed redemption, clearly defined yields, inherently liquid and tradable. The debt obligor bears no operating risk and has not experienced maturity extensions.

      <Table.Td>Rights to rental income from assets (e.g., houses, vehicles, equipment, fixed assets)</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>
        RWA holders receive rental income. Rental income must be packaged as a whole, not split into different classes/grades of non-fungible income. Only assets with executed leases qualify. Assets
        not yet leased or vacant must use Model F.

      <Table.Td>Profit-sharing from business operations (e.g., revenue sharing of core business, or a single product line)</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>
        Enterprises should have operating history, higher growth rate, and sustained annual net profitability in recent years. Can package the entire enterprise or split a single product/business for
        issuance. Best suited for businesses with higher net yields and shorter payback cycles.

      <Table.Td>Tangible assets (e.g., nutraceuticals, long shelf-life foods, alcoholic beverages)</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>
        Must support physical delivery. Issuer must hold local sales licenses and have logistics in place. RWA terms must specify regions where physical redemption is guaranteed. Outside those
        regions, RWAs can still be traded, but physical delivery is not supported.

      <Table.Td>
        Package assets into a fund based on valuation. Issuer may offer ownership or income rights. Ownership uses an initial base period to determine NAV and is updated periodically; income rights
        pay out based on fund returns.
