To help investors make informed choices, PicWe’s Risk Grading System classifies tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) into five levels of risk, following traditional finance standards.

#### R1: Low Risk

- Simple and highly liquid
- Very low chance of losing capital

#### R2: Medium-Low Risk

- Straightforward, relatively liquid
- Low probability of capital loss

#### R3: Medium Risk

- Moderately complex
- Some uncertainty of capital loss

#### R4: Medium-High Risk

- Complex and harder to trade
- Higher chance of losing capital

#### R5: High Risk

- Highly complex, illiquid, difficult to value
- Extreme risk of capital loss

With this clear, standardized risk grading, investors can confidently match their $WEUSD-backed RWA investments to their risk tolerance and return goals.
