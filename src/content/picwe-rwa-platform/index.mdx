# PicWe’s RWA Platform

<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', clear: 'both', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '1.25rem' }}>A Decentralized Gateway to Real-World Asset Investing</div>

The PicWe RWA Platform is a core part of our omni-chain ecosystem, designed to make real-world asset (RWA) investing simple, secure, and accessible. By using $WEUSD, our decentralized stablecoin, users can invest in tokenized assets across industries, from bonds and real estate to commodities and businesses, all on-chain.

#### How It Works

- Risk-Based Matching: The platform classifies RWAs by risk level, helping users find opportunities that fit their investment style.
- IROs (Initial RWA Offerings): A new way to issue RWAs on-chain. Smart contracts standardize the process, making it transparent and secure.
- RWA DEX: A decentralized exchange where newly launched RWA tokens can be traded, aligning incentives between project teams and investors.
- **Single-chain issuance: Assets are created and recorded on one blockchain first (a single source of truth).**
- **Omni-chain distribution: Once an asset exists, it can then be moved, traded, or accessed across all blockchains seamlessly, through PicWe’s Omni-chain infrastructure.**

**Why It Matters**

By integrating $WEUSD, the platform connects on-chain liquidity with off-chain assets. This means $WEUSD is not just for crypto trading, it can also be used for:

- Cross-chain settlements
- RWA investments
- Real-world payments and settlement

The PicWe RWA Platform brings value investing back to Web3, giving both individuals and institutions access to real-world opportunities through a decentralized, borderless system.
