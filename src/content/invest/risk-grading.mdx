- Historical performance data
- Collateralization level

### 2. Issuer Credibility

- Track record
- Financial strength
- Operational capacity

### 3. Market Conditions

- Sector health
- Economic environment
- Regulatory landscape

### 4. Structural Protections

- Seniority in capital structure
- Covenants and triggers
- Insurance coverage

## Matching with Investor Profiles

| Risk Level | Compatible Profiles |
|------------|---------------------|
| R1 | C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 |
| R2 | C2, C3, C4, C5 |
| R3 | C3, C4, C5 |
| R4 | C4, C5 |
| R5 | C5 only |

Conservative investors (C1) should only invest in R1 assets, while aggressive investors (C5) can access all risk levels.

## Important Considerations

### Floor Price Protection

All RWA tokens on Origin Forge have floor price protection. However:
- Floor price ≠ purchase price
- Loss between floor and purchase is possible
- Higher risk = larger potential gap

### Diversification

Consider spreading investments across:
- Multiple risk levels
- Different asset types
- Various issuers

### Due Diligence

Risk grades are informational:
- Review asset details personally
- Understand specific risks
- Consider your financial situation
