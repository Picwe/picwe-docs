## Important Notes

### Profile is Advisory

- PicWe provides guidance, not financial advice
- You're responsible for investment decisions
- Consider consulting a financial advisor

### Diversification Matters

Even aggressive investors should consider:
- Spreading across multiple assets
- Including lower-risk components
- Not over-concentrating in single investments

### Floor Price Protection

Remember: All Origin Forge tokens have floor price protection, providing a safety net across all risk levels.
