# Invest Module

<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
Structured RWA investments with risk-based matching
</div>

---

## Overview

The Invest Module is an **independent investment platform** that offers structured investment products for users seeking stable, predictable returns from **low-risk RWAs (R1-R2)**. 

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Independent Platform** — Not limited to Origin Forge assets; accepts RWAs from various institutional partners
- **Focus on R1-R2 Assets** — Primarily targets very low to low risk assets
- **Fixed-Term Investments** — Provides defined APY with lock-up periods
- **Institutional Partnerships** — Works with compliant institutions like **DigiFT** for assets such as US Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and other regulated securities

---

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Asset Platform

The Invest Module accepts RWAs from multiple sources:
- **Origin Forge Assets** — RWA tokens minted through Origin Forge protocol
- **Institutional Partners** — Assets from compliant institutions like **DigiFT**
  - US Treasury bonds
  - Corporate bonds
  - Stocks and equities
  - Other regulated securities
- **Third-Party Issuers** — Other verified RWA issuers

**Current Partner:** [DigiFT](https://digift.com) — A compliant digital asset platform providing tokenized traditional securities.

### 2. Risk-Based Classification

The Invest Module focuses on **R1 and R2 assets** (very low to low risk). While RWAs are classified into five risk levels (R1-R5), the Invest Module primarily serves conservative investors seeking stable returns:

| Level | Risk | Typical Assets |
|-------|------|----------------|
| R1 | Very Low | Government bonds, treasury bills |
| R2 | Low | Corporate bonds, secured lending |
| R3 | Medium | Real estate, revenue shares |
| R4 | High | Growth equity, venture |
| R5 | Very High | Speculative, early-stage |

### 3. Investor Profile Matching

Investors are matched to appropriate assets based on their profile (C1-C5):

| Profile | Suitable Risk Levels | Focus |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| C1 | R1 only | Capital preservation |
| C2 | R1-R2 | Stable income |
| C3 | R1-R3 | Balanced growth |
| C4 | R1-R4 | Growth oriented |
| C5 | R1-R5 | Maximum returns |

### 4. Flexible Terms

Investment periods range from short to long term:

| Term | Duration | Typical APY Range |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Short | 1-4 weeks | 3-6% |
| Medium | 1-3 months | 5-10% |
| Long | 6-12 months | 8-15% |

*APY varies by asset and market conditions.*

## How It Works

### Investment Flow

![Investment Lifecycle](/images/invest/invest-process.svg)

1. **Select Asset** — Choose from available RWA investments
2. **Deposit WEUSD** — Commit funds for the term
3. **Lock-up Period** — Funds invested in underlying RWA
4. **Receive Returns** — Principal + APY at maturity

### Contract Interface

**Invest:**
```solidity
function invest(
    uint256 assetId, // Asset identifier
    uint256 amount   // WEUSD amount (6 decimals)
) external returns (
    uint256 investmentId // Unique investment ID
)
```

**Redeem:**
```solidity
function redeem(
    uint256 investmentId // Investment to redeem
) external returns (
    uint256 profit // Profit received
)
```

## Investment Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Asset ID** | Identifier for the RWA investment |
| **Minimum** | Minimum investment amount |
| **Maximum** | Maximum investment per wallet |
