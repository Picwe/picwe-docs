# IRO — Initial RWA Offering

<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
Permissionless framework for launching tokenized real-world assets
</div>

## What is IRO?

**Initial RWA Offering (IRO)** is PicWe's standardized framework for issuing tokenized real-world assets. Think of it as an "IPO for RWAs" — but fully decentralized, permissionless, and powered by smart contracts.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Contract Automation

- Token minting fully automated
- No manual intervention for standard operations
- All parameters transparent and verifiable on-chain

### 2. Phased Distribution

| Phase | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Whitelist | Invited | Early access with potential benefits |
| Public | Everyone | Open subscription until cap reached |
| Trading | Everyone | Origin Forge market launches |

### 3. Treasury Pool Mechanism

Every RWA token is backed by a treasury pool:

**Sources:**
- Initial fundraising proceeds
- Trading fees from Origin Forge
- APY distributions
- Additional capital injections

**Management:**
- Automated allocation via smart contracts
- Transparent on-chain tracking
- Supports floor price calculations

### 4. Floor Price Protection

```
Floor Price = Treasury Assets ÷ Circulating Supply
```

This mechanism guarantees a minimum value for RWA tokens:
- **Buy** → Mint new tokens, add funds to treasury
- **Sell** → Burn tokens, maintain treasury value
- **Result** → Floor price can only rise, never fall

## Important Notes

- **Review Process** — Currently, IROs undergo review before launch. Full permissionless issuance coming soon.

- **Risk Disclosure** — RWA tokens are subject to market conditions. Floor price provides downside protection but does not guarantee returns.
