#### Token Swap

- Trade one token for another using **automated liquidity pools.**
- Pay a **trading fee** based on your selected **slippage**:
  - Default: **0.3%** (balances speed and cost)
  - Higher slippage (e.g., 1%) increases trade success but reduces total tokens received.

  - **OKX DEX (EVM):** [web3.okx.com/dex-swap](https://web3.okx.com/dex-swap)
