# Omni-Chain Swap

PicWe’s Omni-Chain Swap uses the Chain Abstraction Transaction Model (CATM) to let users buy assets on any blockchain using assets from another chain, without complex bridges or multiple approvals. This creates safer, faster, and more cost-effective cross-chain liquidity for the Web3 ecosystem.
