Omni-Layer Protocol: True "Any Chain, Any Token" Seamless Cross-Chain Experience
</div>

---

## Overview

Traditional cross-chain bridges are broken: 10-30 minute delays, painful slippage, and questionable security. PicWe's **Omni-Layer Protocol** solves this. We built our own cross-chain infrastructure from scratch—no dependency on third-party bridges, no compromises. The result: sub-minute transfers, near-zero slippage, and a self-balancing liquidity system that keeps everything running smoothly.

### Core Technical Metrics

| Metric | Traditional Bridges | Omni-Layer Protocol |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Cross-Chain Latency** | 10-30 minutes | **15-30 seconds** |
| **Trading Slippage** | 0.5% - 3% | **< 0.1%** |
| **Capital Utilization** | < 30% | **> 90%** |
| **Security Model** | Single trust assumption | **Economic Incentives + Cryptographic Proof** |

## Protocol Architecture

![Cross-Chain Architecture](/omni-protocol-investor-overview.svg)

Four layers. Each one does its job. Together, they make cross-chain just work:

### Layer 1: User Interaction

Multiple ways in. Pick what works for you:

- **Wallet Connect** — MetaMask, Rainbow, whatever you use
- **DApp Frontend** — Clean UI, just works
- **SDK** — Developers: npm install and go
- **API** — Institutions: high-frequency ready

### Layer 2: Omni Relayer Layer — Core

The brain of the protocol. Three tightly integrated components work together to make cross-chain feel like single-chain:

#### Intent Resolution Engine

Users tell us what they want. We figure out how to make it happen—fastest route, best price, lowest risk:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Intent Parser** | Parses user intent, identifies source chain/target chain/asset type |
| **Path Optimizer** | Intelligent routing algorithm, calculates optimal execution path |
| **Price Oracle** | Multi-source aggregated oracle ensuring price accuracy |
| **Risk Assessor** | Real-time risk assessment protecting user assets |

#### Native Cross-Chain Bridge

We don't outsource our bridge. We built it:

- **Our Own Infrastructure** — No Wormhole. No LayerZero. No third-party risk.
- **Burn/Mint Model** — Source chain burns, target chain mints. Clean and simple.
- **Signed Messages** — Every cross-chain message is cryptographically verified.

#### Keeper Network

The muscle behind liquidity balance. Protocol-operated and community-powered Keepers continuously monitor and rebalance pools across all chains:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Balance Monitor** | 24/7 monitoring of pool deviations across all chains |
| **MEV Protector** | Front-running prevention, user transactions stay protected |
| **Arbitrage Engine** | Automated rebalancing through profitable arbitrage |
| **Profit Sharing** | Keepers earn rewards, protocol captures value |

### Layer 3: Liquidity Aggregation

#### DEX Integration

Best price, every time. We route through:

- Uniswap V4 / Curve / Balancer
- 1inch / Paraswap / 0x Protocol
- Smart routing picks the winner automatically

#### WeUSD Self-Balancing Pool Matrix

![WeUSD Pool Matrix](/images/cross-chain/pool-matrix.svg)

Liquidity pools on every chain, connected through our bridge infrastructure. When prices drift, Keepers step in—buy low on one chain, bridge over, sell high on another. The result: prices stay pegged, liquidity stays balanced, and everyone wins.

### Layer 4: RWA Collateral

Every WEUSD is backed 1:1. Real assets, real value:

- USD & USD-equivalent stablecoins
- Real Estate
- Commodities  
- Concert Tickets & Events
- Art & Collectibles
- Carbon Credits
- IP Rights

---

## Core Workflow

Real example: **Buy concert ticket RWA on Ethereum using ETH on Arbitrum. One click. Done.**


### Step 1: Intent Submission

![Intent Submission](/images/cross-chain/intent-submission.svg)

One signature. That's it. You don't need to understand bridges, routing, or gas estimation—we handle everything.

### Step 2: Path Resolution & Optimization

The Intent Resolution Engine automatically executes:

1. **Parse Intent** — Identifies source chain (Arbitrum), target chain (Ethereum), asset type
2. **Query Oracle** — Retrieves real-time prices for ETH/USDC, WEUSD/USDC, RWA/WEUSD
3. **Calculate Optimal Path** — Compares direct swap vs multi-hop routes, selects lowest slippage option
4. **Risk Assessment** — Checks target chain liquidity depth, estimates gas costs

### Step 3: Cross-Chain Execution

![Execution Flow](/images/cross-chain/execution-flow.svg)

Atomic execution: **All or nothing. No stuck funds. No partial fills.**

### Step 4: Asset Delivery

RWA tokens land in your wallet. Typically under 30 seconds for L2-to-L2, under a minute for L1 routes.

- No network switching
- No extra signatures  
- No anxiety about "where's my money"

## WeUSD Self-Balancing Mechanism

This is what makes Omni-Layer different. We don't just move tokens—we keep the entire multi-chain liquidity system in balance.

### The Problem We Solved

Other protocols treat each chain as an island. Result:
- Popular chains have all the liquidity
- Smaller chains get drained
- Big trades cause massive slippage

### Our Solution: Incentive-Aligned Rebalancing

#### Initial State (Imbalanced)

| Pool | WeUSD/USDC Ratio | Deviation |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Ethereum Pool | 1 : 1.02 | +2% (premium) |
| Arbitrum Pool | 1 : 0.98 | -2% (discount) |
| Optimism Pool | 1 : 1.00 | Pegged |

#### Arbitrage Opportunity Detection

The system automatically identifies a **4% arbitrage opportunity**:
- Buy 1 WeUSD on Arbitrum at 0.98 USDC
- Transfer to Ethereum via Omni-Layer Bridge
- Sell on Ethereum at 1.02 USDC
- **Net Profit: ~4% (after gas and fees)**

#### Keeper Execution

Keepers compete to capture the spread. They make money, pools get balanced. Win-win.

![Arbitrage Execution](/images/cross-chain/arbitrage-execution.svg)

#### Result: Balanced Pools

| Pool | WeUSD/USDC Ratio | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Ethereum Pool | 1 : 1.001 | ✅ Balanced |
| Arbitrum Pool | 1 : 0.999 | ✅ Balanced |
| Optimism Pool | 1 : 1.000 | ✅ Balanced |

### Why This Works

- **Profit-Driven Balance** — Keepers rebalance because it's profitable, not because we ask them to
- **Instant Response** — Price drift detected? Arbitrage kicks in within seconds
- **Attack-Resistant** — Manipulation costs more than it's worth
- **Scales Naturally** — More volume = more Keepers = tighter spreads

### Execution Time

| Route Type | Typical Latency | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| L2 ↔ L2 | **15-30 seconds** | Fastest path, optimized relayer |
| L2 ↔ L1 | **30-60 seconds** | L1 finality adds overhead |
| EVM ↔ Movement | **1-3 minutes** | Cross-VM verification required |

## Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Protocol Fee** | 0% | No protocol fee for cross-chain transfers |
| **Source Chain Gas** | Variable | Depends on network congestion |
| **Target Chain Gas** | **Included** | Protocol covers target chain execution costs |

> 💡 **Why free?** Keepers pay for rebalancing because they profit from it. We take a cut of that profit. You pay nothing.

## Security Model

### Defense in Depth

We don't rely on a single security assumption. Multiple layers, each independently robust:

| Layer | How It Works | What It Stops |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Cryptographic Verification** | Every cross-chain message is signed and verified | Message forgery, replay attacks |
| **Economic Incentives** | Keepers profit from keeping things honest | Liquidity manipulation |
| **Real-Time Monitoring** | Continuous pool balance checks | Price depegging |
| **Audited Contracts** | Multiple top-tier audits completed | Code vulnerabilities |

### Traditional Bridges vs Omni-Layer

| Risk | Traditional Bridges | Omni-Layer |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Custodial Risk | ❌ Funds locked in bridge contracts | ✅ Burn/Mint model, no custody |
| Oracle Risk | ❌ Single oracle dependency | ✅ Multi-source price feeds |
| Single Point of Failure | ❌ One contract, one target | ✅ Distributed architecture |
| Liquidity Crisis | ❌ Run on the bridge | ✅ Self-balancing pools |
