Our roadmap for the next two years is designed to systematically build the infrastructure required for a trillion-dollar RWA market. We start by hardening our multi-chain foundation, proceed to integrate diverse real-world assets, and culminate in a fully decentralized, institutional-grade ecosystem.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Multi-Chain Foundation (2026 Q1-Q2)
Building a robust, secure infrastructure across major blockchain networks.
- **EVM Expansion:** Deploy WEUSD on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base for maximum DeFi accessibility.
- **Security First:** Comprehensive smart contract audits and rigorous security protocols.
- **RWA Staking & Lending:** Launch staking mechanisms for RWA tokens and RWA-backed lending protocols to unlock capital efficiency.
- **Asset Integration:** Begin tokenized treasuries integration and WEUSD collateral diversification.

### 2. Cross-Chain & Yield (2026 Q3-Q4)
Expanding beyond EVM chains and activating native yield mechanisms.
- **Non-EVM Expansion:** Extend to Solana and Bitcoin L2s, bringing WEUSD to the entire crypto ecosystem.
- **Native Yield:** Activate WEUSD's yield-bearing properties, allowing holders to earn passive returns.
- **Cross-Chain Liquidity:** Build unified liquidity protocols connecting all supported chains.
- **DAO Launch:** Token generation event ($PIC), community governance, and ve-tokenomics for decentralized control.

### 3. Institutional & Asset Expansion (2027 H1)
Opening doors for institutional capital and diverse asset classes.
- **Institutional Access:** Launch OTC desk, permissioned pools (KYC/KYB), and compliance frameworks.
- **Asset Classes:** Integrate Real Estate yields, Commodities (Gold/Energy), Carbon Credits, and Private Credit.
- **Developer Tools:** Release SDK and API for ecosystem builders.

### 4. Global RWA Economy (2027 H2)
Establishing PicWe as the universal settlement layer for tokenized real-world assets.
- **PicWe Chain:** Launch dedicated L2 optimized for RWA transactions with zero-gas capabilities.
- **Payment Gateway:** RWA-backed payment infrastructure for real-world commerce.
- **Unified Liquidity:** Seamless liquidity layer connecting all chains and asset types.
- **Vision:** Trillion-dollar TVL target through full decentralization and global adoption.
