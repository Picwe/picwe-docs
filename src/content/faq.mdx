# FAQ

**Q1: What does PicWe do?**\
**A:** PicWe lets different blockchains trade directly with each other without using third-party bridges. Think of it as ships exchanging goods directly on the ocean instead of docking at a central port. This makes transactions faster, cheaper, and safer. Currently, PicWe is live on the Movement blockchain.

**Q2: How can you trade across chains without a bridge?**\
**A:** Normally, blockchains rely on bridges (like ferries) to move assets. PicWe uses smart contracts to let two blockchains trade assets directly, no bridge needed. It’s a bridge-less cross-chain solution for safer, faster trading.

**Q3: Do I need a new wallet to use PicWe?**\
**A:** No. You can use your existing wallets like OKX, Pontem, Nightly, or Razor Wallet on the Movement chain.

**Q4: Is direct trading safe?**\
**A:** Yes! In fact, it’s safer than traditional cross-chain bridges because your assets stay on your own blockchain. There’s no centralized dock that can be hacked.

**Q5: What’s wrong with cross-chain bridges?**\
**A:** In 2023, 80% of cross-chain hacks targeted bridges. Bridges act like central docks where assets are stored. If hacked, all funds can be lost. PicWe avoids this risk by keeping assets on their original blockchain and enabling secure bridge-less trading.

**Q6: What happens if my transaction fails?**\
**A:** Your assets are always safe. If a transaction doesn’t go through, smart contracts automatically return your assets. Everything is transparent and verifiable on-chain, with no human intervention required.
