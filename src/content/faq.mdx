## General

### What is PicWe?

PicWe is a full-stack Real-World Asset (RWA) capital markets ecosystem. We provide infrastructure for RWA issuance, trading, and settlement through decentralized smart contracts and our native stablecoin $WEUSD.

PicWe introduces **Origin Forge**, a revolutionary minting protocol that provides:
- Infinite liquidity without LPs

### Is PicWe decentralized?

Yes. All core operations are executed by smart contracts on public blockchains. No central authority controls fund movements or pricing.

## $WEUSD

### What is $WEUSD?

$WEUSD is PicWe's native stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to USDC. It's designed for cross-chain settlement and RWA transactions.

### How do I get $WEUSD?

Mint $WEUSD by depositing USDC through the [Mint & Redeem](/mint-and-redeem) function. 1 USDC = 1 $WEUSD.

### Can I redeem $WEUSD for USDC?

Yes, anytime. Redemption is instant and at 1:1 ratio.

### Which chains support $WEUSD?

- BSC Mainnet
- Base Mainnet
- Arbitrum One
- HashKey Chain

- Movement

### Are there fees for $WEUSD?

## IRO (Initial RWA Offering)

### What is an IRO?

An Initial RWA Offering is PicWe's framework for launching tokenized real-world assets. It's like an "IPO for RWAs" but fully decentralized.

### How do I participate in an IRO?

1. Get $WEUSD
2. Find an active IRO on PicWe
3. Subscribe during whitelist (if eligible) or public phase
4. Claim tokens after market initialization

### Is there a minimum investment?

Each IRO has its own minimum and maximum limits per wallet. Check the specific IRO details.

### Can I get a refund if the IRO fails?

If the soft cap isn't reached and unlock phase is triggered, you can withdraw your $WEUSD.

## Origin Forge

### What is Origin Forge?

Origin Forge is our primary market for RWA tokens. Unlike traditional DEXs where you buy from other users, Origin Forge mints new tokens when you "forge" and burns tokens when you "melt."

### What's the difference between forge and buy?

| Traditional Buy | Forge |
|-----------------|-------|
| Buy from liquidity pool | Mint new tokens |
| Price from pool ratio | Price from algorithm |
| Need LPs | No LPs needed |
| No price floor | Guaranteed floor |

### What is floor price?

The floor price is the guaranteed minimum value of a token. It's calculated as:
```
Floor Price = Reserve ÷ (Supply + k)
```
The floor only increases, never decreases.

### Can the price go to zero?

No. Every token has a floor price backed by reserves. You can always melt at least at floor price.

---

## Invest Module

### What is the Invest Module?

A structured investment platform for low-to-medium risk RWAs with defined terms and APY.

### How is it different from Origin Forge?

| Origin Forge | Invest Module |
|--------------|---------------|
| Continuous trading | Fixed-term investment |
| Variable price | Fixed APY |
| Instant exit | Lock-up period |
| Higher risk/reward | Lower risk, stable returns |

### Can I withdraw before maturity?

No. Investments are locked until the maturity date.

### What are the risk levels?

- **R1**: Very low risk (e.g., government bonds)
- **R2**: Low risk (e.g., corporate bonds)
- **R3**: Medium risk (e.g., real estate)
- **R4**: High risk (e.g., growth equity)
- **R5**: Very high risk (e.g., early-stage)
