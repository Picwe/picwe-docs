The mechanism that guarantees minimum token value

## The Core Promise

> **Every forge raises the floor. The floor never falls.**

This is the fundamental guarantee of Origin Forge. No matter what happens in the market, your tokens have a mathematically guaranteed minimum value backed by real reserves.

---

## Understanding the Two Prices

Origin Forge has two key prices that work together:

| Price | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Floor Price** | Guaranteed minimum, backed by reserves | Only goes up |
| **Current Price** | Market price, driven by demand | Fluctuates above floor |

**Key insight:** Current price can go up or down, but it can never fall below the floor.

## How the Reserve Pool Works

Think of Origin Forge as having a reserve pool that's divided into two parts:

### 1. Floor Support Fund (FSF)

- The portion of reserves that **backs the floor price**
- Guarantees every token can be redeemed at floor value
- This fund grows with every forge and fee

### 2. Price Support Fund (PSF)

- The portion that supports **price above floor**
- Creates the "premium" above floor price
- Fluctuates with market activity

**The floor price = FSF ÷ Total Supply**

---

## The Raise Mechanism

This is the magic that makes floor prices only go up.

### What Triggers a Raise?

When enough buying activity occurs, the protocol automatically:

1. **Detects threshold** — Monitors the ratio between PSF and FSF
2. **Triggers Raise** — Redistributes funds from PSF to FSF
3. **Locks in gains** — Floor price increases permanently

### Why Does This Work?

### Key Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Automatic** | No manual intervention needed |
| **Irreversible** | Once raised, cannot be lowered |
| **Cumulative** | Each raise builds on previous |
| **Transparent** | All calculations on-chain |

---

## What Happens When You Forge?

When you forge (buy) tokens:

1. **Your WEUSD enters the reserve pool**
2. **New tokens are minted for you**
3. **If threshold reached → Raise triggers**
4. **Floor price increases for everyone**

This creates a positive feedback loop:
- More forging → More reserves → Higher floor
- Higher floor → More confidence → More forging

---

## What Happens When You Melt?

When you melt (sell) tokens:

1. **You receive at least floor price in WEUSD**
2. **Your tokens are burned**
3. **Reserve decreases proportionally**
4. **Floor price stays the same or higher**

**Important:** Melting never lowers the floor because tokens and reserves decrease proportionally.

## Comparison: With vs Without Floor

![Token Comparison](/images/origin-forge/token-comparison.svg)

### Traditional Token

- Price can drop to zero
- No guaranteed floor
- Total loss possible

### Origin Forge Token

- Price cannot fall below floor
- Always redeemable at floor
- Downside protected

---

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** A project launches with:
- Initial reserve: $100,000
- Initial supply: 100,000 tokens
- Initial floor: $0.70 per token

**After active trading:**
- Reserve grows to: $500,000
- Supply grows to: 400,000 tokens
- Multiple Raises triggered
- New floor: $1.05 per token (+50%!)

**Your protection:**
- Bought at $1.20
- Market crashes
- Can always melt at $1.05 (floor)
- Maximum loss: 12.5%, not 100%

---

## What Floor Price Means for You

### As a Holder

- **Guaranteed Exit** — Always melt at floor price
- **Limited Downside** — Max loss = current price - floor
- **Unlimited Upside** — Price can rise without limit

### As a Forger

- **Protected Investment** — Your purchase has a floor
- **Value Accrual** — Your activity raises the floor
- **Aligned Incentives** — Everyone benefits from activity

### As an Issuer

- **Investor Confidence** — Floor provides security
- **Sustainable Model** — Value locked permanently
- **Anti-Rug** — Cannot dump below floor

---

## Security Guarantees

### What Can't Happen

❌ Floor cannot be lowered by anyone  
❌ Reserve cannot be drained below floor backing  
❌ Admin cannot change floor parameters  
❌ Token price cannot go below floor

### What Can Happen

✅ Floor rises with activity  
✅ Current price fluctuates above floor  
✅ Users melt at or above floor  
✅ Value accumulates over time

## Summary

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| Floor Direction | Only increases |
| Floor Basis | Real reserves in smart contract |
| Floor Control | Immutable, no admin override |
| Floor Access | Anyone can melt at floor |
| Floor Security | 100% backed by locked WEUSD |

The floor price mechanism transforms RWA tokens from speculative assets into **value-protected instruments**, providing security that traditional markets cannot offer.
