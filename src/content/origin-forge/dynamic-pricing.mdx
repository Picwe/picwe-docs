How Origin Forge calculates token prices algorithmically
</div>

---

## Overview

Prices in Origin Forge are not set by humans or market makers. They're calculated by a mathematical formula based on real-time supply and demand — all backed by real reserves.

---

## The Two Prices

Origin Forge always displays two prices:

| Price | What It Means | Behavior |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Current Price** | What you pay/receive now | Goes up with buying, down with selling |
| **Floor Price** | Guaranteed minimum | Only goes up, never down |

```
Current Price = Floor Price + Market Premium
```

The **market premium** reflects current demand. When demand is high, premium is large. When demand is low, current price approaches floor.

---

## How Prices Move

### Forging (Buying) → Price Goes Up

When you forge tokens:

1. Your WEUSD enters the reserve pool
2. New tokens are minted for you
3. The reserve-to-supply ratio changes
4. **Both current price and floor price tend to increase**

### Melting (Selling) → Price Goes Down

When you melt tokens:

1. Your tokens are burned
2. You receive WEUSD from the reserve
3. The reserve-to-supply ratio adjusts
4. **Current price decreases, but floor stays protected**

---

## The Bonding Curve

Origin Forge uses a **bonding curve** — a mathematical relationship where price increases as supply increases.

![Bonding Curve Behavior](/images/origin-forge/price-behavior.svg)

**Key insight:** The curve is designed so that:
- **Buying** moves you **up** the curve (higher price)
- **Selling** moves you **down** the curve (lower price)
- **Floor** acts as a **bottom rail** that never drops

---

## Actual Transaction Price vs. Displayed Price

⚠️ **Important:** The price you see is the **instantaneous** price. Your actual transaction price may differ.

### Why?

When you buy a significant amount, you're not just buying at one price point — you're buying along the curve:

![Slippage and Price Impact](/images/origin-forge/bonding-curve-slippage.svg)

### Slippage Protection

To protect against unexpected price movements:
- Set a **maximum slippage** when trading
- Transaction reverts if price moves beyond your limit
- Recommended: 1-3% for normal trades

---

## What Affects the Price?

| Factor | Effect on Current Price | Effect on Floor |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| More forging | ↑ Increases | ↑ May increase |
| More melting | ↓ Decreases | → Stays same |
| Raise triggered | ↓ May decrease\* | ↑ Increases |
| Fees collected | ↑ Increases | ↑ Increases |
| APY distributed | ↑ Increases | ↑ Increases |

\* **Note:** When a Raise happens, the current price might temporarily dip because value is transferred from price premium to floor support. However, this is a **feature** — you're getting more floor protection.

---

## Raise Events and Price Resets

When buying activity reaches certain thresholds, a **Raise** event triggers:

### Before Raise
```
Current Price: $2.00
Floor Price: $1.00
Premium: $1.00 (50% of price)
```

### After Raise
```
Current Price: $1.80 (may decrease!)
Floor Price: $1.40 (permanently higher!)
Premium: $0.40 (reduced)
```

**The trade-off:** Slightly lower current price for significantly higher guaranteed floor. This is **good** for holders because:
- Your downside is now limited to $1.40 instead of $1.00
- The floor can never go back down
- Long-term value is locked in

## True Market Price Discovery

### Why Origin Forge Pricing is Fair

| Property | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Algorithmic** | No humans setting prices |
| **Transparent** | Formula is open source |
| **Immutable** | Parameters fixed at launch |
| **Backed** | Every price point has real reserves |

### Comparison: Origin Forge vs. Traditional Markets

| Aspect | Order Books | AMM DEX | Origin Forge |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Price Source | Bid/Ask | Pool ratio | Algorithm + reserve |
| Manipulation | Possible | Possible | Very difficult |
| Price Floor | None | None | Built-in |
| Large Trades | Need liquidity | High slippage | Predictable impact |

---

## Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Current Price** | Market-driven, can fluctuate |
| **Floor Price** | Reserve-backed, only increases |
| **Bonding Curve** | Mathematical price discovery |
| **Raise Mechanism** | Locks value into floor |
| **Transparency** | All calculations verifiable on-chain |

Origin Forge pricing is designed to be **fair**, **predictable**, and **protective** — giving traders confidence that the market is honest and their downside is always limited.
