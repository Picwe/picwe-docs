A revolutionary token minting protocol — where tokens are born, not traded

## We Are Not an Exchange

> **Origin Forge is the birthplace of tokens, not a marketplace.**

Traditional token trading involves buying from and selling to other users through liquidity pools. Origin Forge is fundamentally different:

- **You don't buy tokens** — you **forge** them into existence
- **You don't sell tokens** — you **melt** them back into WEUSD
- **Tokens are minted on demand**, not pre-allocated

---

## The Paradigm Shift

| Aspect | Traditional DEX | Origin Forge |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Nature** | Secondary market (swapping) | Primary market (minting) |
| **Token Source** | Buy from pool/users | Mint new tokens |
| **Token Exit** | Sell to pool/users | Burn to protocol |
| **Liquidity** | Depends on LPs | Always infinite |
| **Price Floor** | Can go to zero | Guaranteed minimum |
| **Price Discovery** | Pool ratio (x\*y=k) | Reserve-backed curve |

```
Traditional:  Fixed Supply → Market Trading → Price Discovery
Origin Forge: Market Demand → Mint at Price → Value Backed
```

## How It Works

### Two Operations

| Operation | Action | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Forge** | Mint | Deposit WEUSD → Receive newly minted RWA tokens |
| **Melt** | Burn | Return RWA tokens → Receive WEUSD from reserve |

### The Reserve Pool

Every forge deposits WEUSD into a **reserve pool**. This pool backs the value of all tokens:

## Two Key Prices

Every RWA token in Origin Forge has two prices:

| Price | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Current Price** | What you pay/receive when forging/melting | Fluctuates with activity |
| **Floor Price** | Guaranteed minimum value | Only goes up, never down |

![Price Behavior](/images/origin-forge/price-behavior.svg)

**The key insight:** Current price can fluctuate, but can **never drop below the floor**.

---

## The Floor Only Goes Up

This is the magic of Origin Forge:

### How?

1. **Forging adds to reserves** — More backing for all tokens
2. **Fees accumulate** — Transaction fees grow the reserve
3. **Raise mechanism triggers** — Protocol automatically locks in gains

### Why This Matters

| Traditional Token | Origin Forge Token |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Can drop to zero | Has guaranteed floor |
| No backing | 100% reserve backed |
| Total loss possible | Downside limited |

**Origin Forge handles minting. Secondary markets are optional.**

## Quick Summary

| Concept | Traditional | Origin Forge |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Get tokens | Buy from others | Forge (mint) new tokens |
| Exit tokens | Sell to others | Melt (burn) back to WEUSD |
| Liquidity | Depends on market | Always available |
| Minimum value | None | Floor price (guaranteed) |
| Floor direction | N/A | Only increases |
