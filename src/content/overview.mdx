## The Problem

Traditional capital markets have significant limitations:

- **Geographic Barriers** — Many assets are only accessible to local investors
- **High Entry Costs** — Minimum investments often exclude retail participants
- **Illiquidity** — Real-world assets are difficult to trade once acquired
- **Opaque Pricing** — Price discovery is slow and non-transparent
- **Counterparty Risk** — Centralized intermediaries create single points of failure

Meanwhile, blockchain technology offers solutions—24/7 global access, transparent records, programmable contracts—but most platforms focus on digital-native assets, leaving real-world assets untapped.

## PicWe's Solution

PicWe bridges this gap with a complete RWA capital markets infrastructure:

### 1. $WEUSD — Settlement Layer

A stablecoin that works natively across multiple blockchains, enabling seamless value transfer without bridge risks.

### 2. IRO — Issuance Layer

A permissionless framework for launching tokenized RWAs through standardized smart contracts, with built-in investor protections.

### 3. Origin Forge — Liquidity Layer

A revolutionary minting protocol where tokens are forged on demand, providing infinite liquidity and floor price protection.

### 4. Invest Module — Management Layer

Structured investment products with risk-based classification, matching investors with appropriate opportunities.

## How It Works

![PicWe Workflow](/images/overview-workflow.svg)

**Lifecycle:**

1. **Issuance (IRO)** — Asset issuer creates RWA, investors subscribe
2. **Market Launch** — Trading begins on Origin Forge
3. **Continuous Trading** — Users forge/melt tokens at algorithmically determined prices
4. **Value Accrual** — Floor price rises as market activity increases

## Key Differentiators

### Origin Forge vs Traditional DEX

| Aspect | Traditional DEX (AMM) | Origin Forge |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| Nature | Secondary market | Primary market |
| Token Source | Buy from liquidity pool | Mint new tokens |
| Liquidity | Requires LPs | Infinite, protocol-backed |
| Price Floor | None, can go to zero | Guaranteed minimum value |
| Price Discovery | Constant product (x*y=k) | Dynamic curve + floor |

### Floor Price Protection

> Every forge raises the floor. The floor never falls.

When you melt tokens, you're guaranteed at least the floor price—a mathematical minimum backed by protocol reserves.
