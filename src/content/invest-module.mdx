The Invest Module lets users participate in low-risk real-world assets (R1/R2) and earn predictable returns. Using $WEUSD, you can choose investment durations ranging from 1 week to 12 months, each offering different APYs.

#### Features

- Easy Dashboard: See asset name, issuer, APY, and remaining subscription amount at a glance.
- Flexible Staking: Assets stop earning yield at maturity but can be unstaked at any time.
- Stable Returns: Focused on low-risk RWAs, ideal for conservative or moderately conservative investors.

This module is perfect for users seeking secure, predictable, and automated real-world asset investing within the PicWe ecosystem.
