<div style={{ color: 'rgb(110,110,100)', clear: 'both', fontSize: '1.125rem', marginTop: '1.25rem' }}>A Permissionless and Flexible Framework for RWA Issuance.</div>

The IRO is PicWe’s permissionless and flexible framework for issuing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain. It’s designed for assets with long-term real-world value, allowing projects and investors to participate in a secure, decentralized, and automated way.

#### Key Features

1. **Smart Contract-Based Issuance**:&#x20;

- Token minting is fully automated via smart contracts.
- Supply grows only if on-chain activity supports it, ensuring transparency and security.

2. **Whitelist System**:

- Early participants can access favorable pricing through points, events, or community contributions.

3. **Permissionless Participation**:&#x20;

- Anyone can join an IRO, with subscription limits set per wallet address.

4. **Treasury Pool:**

- Backed by real assets and controlled by smart contracts. Sources of funds include: fundraising, bonding curve trades, and APY payouts.

5. **RWA Floor Price:**&#x20;

- Calculated by Total Treasury Assets ÷ Circulating Supply. This guarantees a minimum value for RWA tokens.

6. **Downside Protection:**

- Every trade adds funds to the treasury. Buys mint tokens, sells burn tokens. The floor price can only rise, never fall.

Result: A safer, more transparent way to trade and value real-world assets.

**How to Launch an RWA via IRO:**

**Step 1 – Connect Wallet**

- Use your wallet to manage ownership of the RWA. Keep your private key secure.

**Step 3 – Configure Issuance Parameters**

The IRO module makes RWA issuance decentralized, transparent, and accessible, letting both creators and investors participate in the growing tokenized asset economy powered by $WEUSD.
