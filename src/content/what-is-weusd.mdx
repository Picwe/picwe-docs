## Definition

**WEUSD** is not just another stablecoin. It's the settlement layer for the entire RWA economy—designed from day one to be backed by real-world assets, work across every chain, and serve as the universal currency for tokenized assets.

Today, WEUSD is minted 1:1 against USDC. Tomorrow, it's backed by a diversified basket of RWA collateral: real estate yields, commodity reserves, treasury bonds, and more. Same stability. Deeper backing. Real-world value you can actually touch.

## Core Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Peg** | 1 WEUSD = 1 USD, always |
| **Current Collateral** | 100% USDC (Phase 1) |
| **Future Collateral** | Diversified RWA basket—real estate, commodities, treasuries |
| **Decimals** | 6 |
| **Architecture** | Omni-chain native, no bridges needed |

## The Vision: RWA-Backed Stability

### Phase 1: USDC Foundation (Now)

We start simple and secure:
- 1:1 USDC backing
- Instant mint/redeem
- Battle-tested stability

### Phase 2: RWA Collateral Expansion (Coming)

As the RWA ecosystem matures, WEUSD collateral diversifies:

| Collateral Type | Characteristics |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Tokenized Treasuries** | US T-Bills, sovereign bonds—the safest assets on earth |
| **Real Estate Yields** | Cash flows from commercial and residential properties |
| **Commodity Reserves** | Gold, silver, and other hard assets |
| **Revenue-Generating RWA** | Concert tickets, IP royalties, carbon credits |

Why does this matter? **Yield-bearing collateral means WEUSD holders can earn passive returns**—without sacrificing stability.

### Phase 3: Full RWA Economy

WEUSD becomes the reserve currency of tokenized finance:
- Central settlement for all RWA trades
- Cross-border payments without forex friction
- Institutional-grade liquidity across every chain

## The Bottom Line

WEUSD is where traditional stablecoins meet the future of finance. We're starting with the most trusted collateral (USDC), building the most advanced infrastructure (omni-chain), and expanding into the most promising asset class (RWA).
