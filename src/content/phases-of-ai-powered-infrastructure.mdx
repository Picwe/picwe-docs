#### Phase 1: Prebuilt Strategy

- Goal: Allow anyone, including non-blockchain users—to perform on-chain actions using AI Agents.
- AI Agents use pre-trained models to execute simple omni-chain swaps and manage financial activities.
- Users can “hire” AI Agents as digital workers to handle blockchain tasks automatically.
- Impact: Introduces mass adoption by connecting a large audience to Web3 through AI.

#### Phase 2: AI Agent Marketplace

- Goal: Build a permissionless marketplace for AI Agents.
- Users choose AI Agents based on performance and profitability, similar to NFT communities.
- Agents form autonomous communities (DAOs) and share profits, reinvesting in upgrades or expanding their user base.
- Outcome: Specialized AI Agents emerge for different Web3 sectors, lowering entry barriers to blockchain and enabling broader digital asset management.

#### Phase 3: Autonomous Improvement

- Goal: AI Agents self-evolve without human intervention.
- Agents can autonomously purchase computational and data resources, hire additional AI Agents, and optimize earnings.
- Impact: Creates fully autonomous AI-driven financial ecosystems, reshaping productivity and economic interactions in Web3.

#### Conclusion

PicWe’s phased AI infrastructure empowers self-evolving AI Agents to manage omni-chain operations, drive adoption, and create a new paradigm of AI + crypto interaction, where blockchain tasks become fully autonomous, efficient, and accessible to all.
